Current Release
v2.5 2015-01-31
Updated the Medic's "Über activated!" lines to be specific for the Medi Gun and the Kritzkrieg/Quick-Fix. Also, I added an approximate timer for the Übercharge which has a secondary caption for 50% and the Über expiring. It lasts for roughly 7.5 seconds, the average Übercharge time, which can be reduced by charging multiple targets. So, like I said, it's an approximation.

v2.4.2 2015-01-26
Added some <len:#> tags to the Weapon Switcher captions so that they disappear after 1 second. If this is undesired, contact me on Steam.

v2.4.1 2014-12-22
Added some fancy numbers in circles (like ???) to the weapon switcher captions so you know what slot it is at a glance.

v2.4 2014-12-22
Changed date format for the readme to follow some ISO standard. Also added some more taunt lines in case you were getting flooded by "No caption found for x.y.z" in your consoles.

By the way, please read the readme_also.txt before asking me why X and Y actions/events aren't captioned.

v2.3.1 11/9/14
Added readme_also.txt, which contains many things people request from captions that aren't currently possible. Please read it before asking me to add a feature which I've already tried and determined impossible at the current moment.

v2.3 10/26/14
Added captions for the Helltower spells. They'll be in the same green that Merasmus and the Skeletons use in the killfeed.

v2.2 6/29/14
Added all new #Clear.X captions, where X is the number of caption lines you wish you clear. I've included 1-6, and if you need more, you can copy and paste mine to make your own.

v2.1 6/19/14
Added blank captions for the new dancing taunts added to get rid of the "No caption found for X" errors in the console.

v2.0 5/24/14
Damn, we're already at 2.0?

Added captions for weapon switcher scripts. See CaptionsInScripts page on the Google Code project wiki for details.

v1.9 3/30/14
I've extracted every single voice line caption, including the MvM ones that I left blank, from the game. If you still get those "No caption found for x.y.z" errors AFTER UPDATING, let me know and I'll see what went wrong.
